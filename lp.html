							<p><strong>Gluon</strong> is a business city in the metaverse, independent of most current biases such as nationalities, regions, colour, currencies and religion. Anybody can join the city to start a new life with equal opportunities. The metaverse introduces a unique communication experience through the combination of both traditional and blockchain mechanics. We believe brain understanding is gearing up, more and more engineering and interfacing with brain in the future is coming. <strong> Next generation is less likely to trade off real world for VR and AR experiences</strong>, we envision VR future would be much like reading a book. Staying in pods or making moves while wearing headsets is not going to work in the long run,  that’s why Gluon is working on <strong>voice, access, gestures and emotional controls to mimic the real life</strong> in the metaverse city. Residents will have voice, gestures and access controls similar to real life, make calls, leave notes and search each other to their location in the city while staying completely anonymous. People will be recognised from their wallet holdings.
							</p></br>
							<h2>Goals</h2>
							<p>1. Removing current political and economic biases by providing space to promote merit culture for innovation. </p>
							<p>2. Developing tools to mimic real life in the metaverse.
							</p>
							<p>3. Promoting ownership, free will, privacy, decentralisation and connectivity with anonymity. </p>
							<P>4. Providing platform for everyone to enhance the metaverse experience for all of us by designing assets and developing functionalities. </P></br>
							
							<h2>Technologies</h2>
							<P>Gluon is promoting meritocracy based on decentralising tools such as blockchain, try to use and develop open source technologies wherever possible. Mozilla hubs, AWS, Linux, GitHub, Solana, metaplex and  sketchfab community are the power house of Gluon. More communities will be formed around the Gluon city to accelerate the development. Open APIs and SDKs will be provided to bring more assets and functionalities to the Gluon city. We are building on  Solana, currently the most efficient and robust chain (carbon neutral) and experiencing the highest interest from the developer community.
							</P></br>

							<h2>Project Outline</h2>
